Contributing code to OMEGA

Contributions of external code to OMEGA are both desired and encouraged. Any and all functions/code enhancements are welcomed, whether they are e.g. new reconstruction algorithms, image analysis tools or new supported scanners (even simply main files). For great ideas on where to start contributing, search the codebase for "TODO" flags. 

If you wish to add your own code to OMEGA, you should either open an issue, submit a pull request or simply send an e-mail to me. The function can be either m-file, py-script, C++-file or OpenCL (cl) function.

If the function is a new reconstruction algorithm written in m-file or py-script, it can be ported by the OMEGA developer(s) to OpenCL, depending on the complexity of the algorithm. Functions utilizing e.g. the forward and backward projections of OMEGA can be included as well.

New algorithms will be added to the list of supported algorithms along with the provided citation(s). Other features will be added to the feature list along with the provided citation(s). The function itself should include mention of the authors of the file and the license.

Functions do not need to include documentation or examples, however, depending on the complexity of the code, this might delay the publication and inclusion of the code.
