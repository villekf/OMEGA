%% MATLAB codes for fan-beam CT reconstruction using FIPS walnut projection images
% This file is an example for the 2D (sinogram) reconstruction of the FIPS
% walnut (https://zenodo.org/record/1254206)
% Any of the sinograms can be used, but the default parameters are for
% Data164.mat.
% This example script contains examples for both built-in reconstruction
% (first) and for manual reconstruction using the built-in class for A * x
% and A' * y operations (second). The latter one has examples of
% LSQR, both with the sparse system matrix as well as one-the-fly
% computation of the system matrix.
% NOTE: This script uses implementation 1 by default. This is not optimal
% for CT-reconstruction due to the projector used but it is the fastest
% reconstruction method for 2D data. For a more optimal reconstruction,
% quality-wise, set options.projector_type = 4 and options.implementation
% to either 2 or 5.
